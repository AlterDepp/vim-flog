INTRODUCTION                                    *flog*

Flog is a lightweight branch viewer for vim. Flog provides a wrapper to "git
log --graph" that can be run from any git repository. It provides several
helpful commands and bindings to interact with the graph. Flog integrates with
|fugitive|. See "git log --help" and |fugitive| for more details.

COMMANDS                                        *flog-commands*

                                                *flog-:Flog*
:Flog

  Open the log graph in a new tab. This command can be run from any file in a
  git repository. Any |fugitive-commands| can be run from the buffer. The
  following options are supported:

  -all                  Enable the "--all" argument by default.
  -bisect               Enable the "--bisect" argument by default.
  -no-merges            Enable the "--no-merges" argument by default.
  -reflog               Enable the "--reflog" argument by default.
  -skip=<number>        Passed to "--skip", skipping that number of commits by
                        default.
  -max-count=<number>   Passed to "--max-count", limiting to that number of
                        commits by default.
  -open-cmd=<cmd>       The command to use to open the window containing the
                        graph. Must give initial focus to the window. Defaults
                        to |tabedit|.
  -format=<format>      A format specifier to pass to "--pretty=format:".
                        Multiline formats are supported.
  -date=<date>          The date format to pass to "--date=". Currently,
                        "short" and "iso8601" are supported.
  -search=<rev>         A regex pattern to pass to "--grep=" and "-G".
  -rev=<rev>            The git revision to pass to the log command.
  -path=<path>          A path to pass to the log command. This option can be
                        specified multiple times for multiple paths.
  -raw-args=<args>      Additional args to pass to "git log --graph". No args
                        passed in using this option are guaranteed to work.
                        Can be specified multiple times, which will be
                        combined together.
  --                    Parse the rest of the arguments as if they were passed
                        to -raw-args. Does not require escaping spaces.

:Flogsplit                                      *flog-:Flogsplit*

  Open the log graph in a split. Supports |<mods>|. Behaves the same as
  |:Flog| otherwise.

:Flogsplitcommit                                *flog-:Flogsplitcommit*

  Open a commit under the cursor using |:Gsplit| in a |flog-preview-window|.
  Can only be run in the |:Flog| window.

:Floggit                                        *flog-:Floggit*

  Open a git command via |:Git|.

  File completion is available from this command, as well as completion for
  the commits and refs under the cursor. Completion applies to the first and
  last lines of the currently or previously selected range if the cursor is on
  the first or last line of the range. Completion is also available for the
  commit range using the visual selection range, ex. "COMMIT1..COMMIT2".

  This command can only be run in the |:Flog| window.

:Floggit!                                       *flog-:Floggit!*

  Same as |:Floggit|, but uses |:Git!|. In neovim, this is always used.

:Flogupdate                                     *flog-:Flogupdate*

  Update the arguments passed to |:Flog| or |:Flogsplit|. Can only be run in a
  |:Flog| window. Merges new arguments with the current arguments.

:Flogupdate!                                    *flog-:Flogupdate!*

  Same as |:Flogupdate|, but overwrite all of the current arguments instead of
  updating them.

:Flogjump                                       *flog-:Flogjump*

  Jump to the ref name given by the arguments. Must be a ref name currently in
  the graph. Can only be run in a |:Flog| window. Supports completion.

For more details, help and installation, see AnsiEsc:
<https://github.com/vim-scripts/AnsiEsc.vim>

PREVIEW WINDOWS                                 *flog-preview-window*

To view more information from the graph, you can open "Flog preview windows".
Opening a command in Flog preview windows closes any previously opened preview
windows. Flog preview windows will be closed when quitting Flog.

ADVANCED USAGE                                  *flog-advanced-usage*

Flog keeps an open API in order to allow you to customize it to suit your git
workflow.

The best way to discover how to use the API is by reading it:
https://github.com/rbong/vim-flog/blob/master/autoload/flog.vim

Example: to add a command to Flog that displays a diff for the current "-path"
and the commit under the cursor, add the following to your |.vimrc|.
>
  function! Flogdiff(mods) abort
    let l:path = fnameescape(flog#get_state().path[0])
    let l:commit = flog#get_commit_data(line('.')).short_commit_hash
    call flog#preview(a:mods . ' split ' . l:path . ' | Gvdiff ' . l:commit)
  endfunction

  augroup flog
    autocmd FileType floggraph command! -buffer -nargs=0 Flogdiff call Flogdiff('<mods>')
  augroup END
<

By running ":Flogdiff" in the Flog graph window, you can now see a diff of the
file passed in with the "-path=" option against the commit under the cursor.
